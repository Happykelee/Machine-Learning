Sometimes fabrics come along that simply can't wait for anything. They're so rare that we have to offer them to you the second we get our hands on them. While it might be cold today, planning ahead now for summer will get you a huge reward in the form of these two dead stock Cone natural selvedges. We're making the decision even easier with a special value of $71. Twill or Duck Canvas, that's your hardest decision.

While there is no indigo to be found in these fabrics, the creamy color is perfectly at home when the sun comes out. Casual and breezy, these styles offer an ideal escape from the confines of dark denim. Flecks of cotton plant speck the surface of this fabric, giving them extra character. Solid weight and low starch create a sturdy pair of denim that's still quite wearable. Of course, the classic denim cut helps these pants retain the timeless look we all love in our favorite denim.

The fact that this selvedge is never to be seen again makes it even more special.
